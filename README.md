Problem statement 
Using K-means clustering with the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model, customer segments for an online retailer (such as Snapdeal) can be identified as distinct groups with similar purchasing behaviors. Common segments found in such projects include high-value loyal customers, budget-conscious occasional shoppers, and at-risk customers.
